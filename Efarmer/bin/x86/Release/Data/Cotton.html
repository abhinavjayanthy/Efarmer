<p><em><strong>Cotton Crop:</strong></em></p>
<p><b><img src="images/cotton.png" width="1003" height="100" alt="cotton_image"></b></p>
<p><strong>What is Cotton?</strong></p>
<p>#Cotton is a cashcrop.</p>
<p>#Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber that grows in a boll, or protective capsule, around the seeds of cotton plants of the genus Gossypium.</p>
<p>#Cotton is a natural fiber used to produce textiles.</p>
<p><strong>Climate Conditions Required</strong></p>
<p>Cotton is a short-day plant but day-neutral varieties exist. However, the effect of daylength on flowering is influenced by temperature. Germination is optimum at temperatures of 18 to 30°C, with minimum of 14°C and maximum of 40°C. Delayed germination exposes seeds to fungus infections in the soil. For early vegetative growth, temperature must exceed 20°C with 30°C as desirable. For proper bud formation and flowering, daytime temperature should be higher than 20°C and night temperature higher than 12°C, but should not exceed 40 and 27°C respectively. Temperatures between 27 and 32°C are optimum for boll development and maturation but above 38°C yields are reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Water Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Depending on climate and length of the total growing period, cotton needs some 700 to 1300 mm to meet its water requirements (ETm). In the early vegetative period, crop water requirements are low, or some 10 percent of total. They are high during the flowering period when leaf area is at its maximum, or some 50 to 60 percent of total. Later in the growing period the requirements decline. In relation to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) the crop coefficient (kc) for the different development stages is: for the initial stage 0.4-0.5 (20 to 30 days), the development stage 0.7-0.8 (40 to 50 days), the mid-season stage 1.05-1.25 (50 to 60 days), the late-season stage 0.8-0.9 (40 to 55 days), and at harvest 0.65-0. 7.</p>
<p><strong>Water Uptake</strong></p>
<p>From emergence to early flowering, the tap root may extend in deep soils to a depth of 1.8 m. During the flowering period, additional root development occurs in the upper part of the root zone. Frequent, light irrigation application during early growth periods tends to cause shallow root systems. As a rule, some 70 to 80 percent of the total water uptake by the crop occurs over the first 0.9 m depth, where more than 90 percent of the total root weight is found. Normally when the crop is fully grown, 100 percent of the water is extracted from the first 1.0 to 1.7 m soil depth (D = 1.0- 1.7 m). When water supply is terminated, water uptake will increasingly occur from lower soil depths but may not be sufficient during peak water requirement periods to maintain crop evapotranspiration and crop growth. Under conditions when ETm is 5 to 6 mm/day water uptake starts to be reduced when soil water depletion exceeds 65 percent (p = 0.65).</p>

<p><strong>Yield</strong></p>
<p>Average yied in tons/ha:</p>
<p id="yph">4</p>                   <!--yield  value to access from c#-->
<p>A good yield of a 160 to 180 day cotton crop under irrigation is 4 to 5 ton/ha seed cotton of which 35 percent is lint. Water utilization efficiency for harvested yield (Ey) for seed cotton containing about 10 percent moisture is 0.4 to 0.6 kg/m3. Boll and fibre properties such as lint to seed ratio, and length, strength and fineness of lint, are primarily determined by the variety and to a lesser extent by irrigation and fertilizer practices. In general, the boll size, and the seed and lint index (weight per 100 seeds) increases under adequate water supply. However, the lint percentage (the ratio lint to seed) tends to decrease. Low soil water depletion levels during yield formation (3) tend to result in longer and finer fibre of decreased strength. The direct effect of water deficits on fibre properties, however, appears to be small because of the shedding of bolls which would have produced inferior fibre when allowed to mature.</p>
<p>Normally cotton seed contains 35 percent oil and 35 percent protein. Under irrigation there is an indication that severe water deficits substantially reduce the oil percentage in the seed, and more fibrous material with 20 percent lower oil and protein content is produced compared to an adequately irrigated crop.</p>
<p><strong>Irrigation Scheduling</strong></p>
<p>To enhance root development, adequate water should be available in the soil at the time of sowing and pre-irrigation is required when stored soil water from pre-season rainfall is not available. In the vegetative period (1) irrigation may be scheduled when some 60 percent of the available soil water over the first 0.75 m has been taken up by the crop. During flowering (2) depletion of some 70 percent of available soil water will in general check vegetative growth without impairing yields; delayed irrigation during this period may cause considerable flower and bud shedding. During yield formation (boll filling) (3) and ripening (4), the soil water depletion may increase from 60 percent to higher values as the season progresses and depending on climate and depth of stored soil water, irrigation can be terminated 4 to 5 weeks before final picking. When grown under conditions of high groundwater tables, even for short duration, and when soils are wet for long periods, the yield decrease may be up to 50 percent, not withstanding unrestricted water use. This may be due to inadequate soil aeration. The same phenomenon has been noticed under very frequent irrigation application.</p>
<p><strong>Irrigation</strong> <strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>Cotton is grown under a great variety of irrigation systems of which furrow irrigation is the most common surface system. In regions where the demand for water is great and water resources are small, sprinkler and drip irrigation methods become more and more accepted to economize on water applied and restrict return flow of low quality. In the Near East region, cotton is also grown under controlled flood or spate irrigation, where with little or no rain a one-time pre-sowing irrigation of 0. 5 to 1 m depth stores sufficient water in the root zone to allow the crop to reach maturity. Under such treatments soils must be deep and have a high water holding capacity. With growing season from August to March with ETm = 700 to 750 mm and ETa = about 450 mm, farmers' yields are about 800 kg/ha, with a maximum of about 1 700 kg/ha seed cotton.</p>
